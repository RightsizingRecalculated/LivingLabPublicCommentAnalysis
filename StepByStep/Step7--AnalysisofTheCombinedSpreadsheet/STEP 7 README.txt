STEP 7 NOTES

This folder contains a spreadsheet file in which I have combined the 1609 public comments form the pdf with the 335 public comments from Inspire Boulder. 

RightsizingPublicAllCommentsFinal.ods

As a courtesy, I am also providing the spreadsheet file in excel (.xlsx) format.

I have added the 335 public comments from Folsom Street Feedback on Inspire Boulder to the sheet labeled “All Comments”. This required changing the order of the columns in the InspireBoulder sheet to match the layout of the main dataset. In the Contact column I have inserted “Inspire Boulder (from Folsom Street Feedback)” to differentiate these comments from the Inspire Boulder comments that were already present in the dataset culled from the pdf.

Similarly, I have added the same 335 public comments from Folsom Street Feedback on Inspire Boulder to the sheet labeled “FolsomAmongOthers” to complete that database subset. 

I have also added 330 public comments from Folsom Street Feedback on Inspire Boulder to the sheet labeled “Folsom Only” to complete that database subset.

Procedures:

(1) I moved the text of the Inspire Boulder answers from column C to column G (Full Comment). 

(2) I deleted the comments of column B.

(3) I inserted the text “Inspire Boulder (from Folsom Streetback)” into column C (contact method).
 
(4) I copied and pasted rows 5-334 to the bottom of the “AllComments” sheet.

(5) I copied and pasted rows 5-334 to the bottom of the “FolsomAmongOthers” sheet.

(6) I copied and pasted rows 10-334 to the bottom of the “FolsomOnly” sheet.

(7) I sorted the new larger dataset in all three modified sheets by column E, Reaction.

(8) I highlighted the beginning row of each different Reaction term yellow, and pasted the resulting beginning and ending rows into a new tables in the sheet “TheAnalysis” to compute the counts and percentages for the complete dataset and the two subsets concerning Folsom.  

Results:

The analysis shows that with respect to the subset of public comments from Inspire Boulder directed at Folsom corridor among others, 60% were negative about ’right’-sizing on the Folsom corridor, while 35% were positive. 

These 60%-35% negative-to-positive ratio of the percentages is more negative than the 46%-45% ratio in the 652 written comments in the dataset from the pdf, but it is consistent with the 59%-35% ratio in the larger set of all 1609 public comments from the pdf.  

Producing the executive summary worksheet:

Not in this spreadsheet file, but in the RightsizingPublicCommentsRecalculated spreadsheet file, I have modified The Analysis to include only the two tables analyzing first the Folsom only data (since that is what staff presented), and all 1944 comments. I moved the sheet named The Analysis to be the first sheet and reordered the Folsom Only and All Comments sheets to match the order presented in The Analysis. All other sheets were removed from the final presentation to present my case as clearly and simply and possible. 

In short I believe I have shown that staff did not do their statistical work correctly. Whether that mistake was deliberate or unintentional, GoBoulder staff have clearly misled council about the degree to which the public disapproves of the ’right’-sizing for Folsom.
