STEP-BY-STEP NOTES

I believe that science and statistical data analysis should be replicable. In each subfolder I have described the steps I took to gather, clean, and analyze the data.
 
This folder also contains a screenshot of the Daily Camera commentator whose observation that two simple word searches on the “Summary of Feedback” pdf released by the Living Lab seemed to contradict staff’s claim that 57% of the public comments were positive while only 40% were negative. S/he found that the word ‘negative’ occurred in the pdf about twice as often as the word ‘positive’ did. I especially appreciated that s/he was candid that some occurrences were not in the classification column (the Reaction column). 

So thank you NotSimpler, whoever you are. You inspired me to do the work that you see here. 

As I dug into the pdf, I realized that it would be more challenging to get accurate numbers from the pdf than I originally thought, especially since staff’s claim applied to the Folsom corridor only rather to all of the public comments—which were what the pdf contains. I realized to count the data by corridor it would be far easier if I first converted from pdf to a spreadsheet format.

Then there was the problem that the conversion of the pdf to a spreadsheet yielded only 1609 comments, while staff had claimed that were approximately 1900 total comments; the subset of the converted pdf contained only 652 Folsom corridor only comments while staff had claimed there were approximately 950. That appeared to be solved when I realized that a second link on the website, the “Folsom Street Feedback from Inspire Boulder” spreadsheet, contained another 335 comments. I estimate it took me about 35 hours over 5 days to compile this spreadsheet and do this analysis.

It would have been simpler to ask the city for their summary of feedback in excel or in a database format, but I could not do that without losing my anonymity. I have a project coming up that will be reviewed by city staff and council, and sadly I do not trust that I would not be retaliated against by staff and/or the 6 members of council for whom ‘right’-sizing appears to be a pet project. So I have chosen to do it the hard way in order to protect my anonymity.

Nonetheless, I do believe the data and analysis to be accurate and I take full responsibility for any errors herein. I welcome any reports of errors. Please replicate and double-check my work as well.
