STEP 2 NOTES

This folder contains the completely unedited conversion of the main PDF to spreadsheet format.  

living-lab-community-feedback-1-201508261015.xlsx
living-lab-community-feedback-1-201508261015.ods

The pdf-to-excel conversion program yielded a .xlsx file which my version of Excel would not open.  I then used the open-source spreadsheet program LibreOffice to open the .xlsx file and then saved it as a LibreOffice spreadsheet (.ods).  

Neither of these files have been edited. They contain artifacts from the conversion program.  

One artifact is that the 200 page pdf file was split into 20 separate sheets, labeled Table 1 through Table 20.

A second artifact is that Table 14 and Table 17 seem to be garbled and do not follow the same columnar format as the other Tables.  

These artifacts had to be cleaned up in Step 3.
