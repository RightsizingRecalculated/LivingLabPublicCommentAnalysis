These were downloaded at approximately 9:07 pm on 8/26/2015, approximately one day after the City Council study session on 8/25/2015.

Note that the files appear to be dated from 8/26/2015 at 10:15am and 10:39am, which means they were updated the morning after the council study session on the evening of 8/25/2015.  Presumably these files are updated regularly. As far as I can tell, they are the most complete record of public comment that is being made available to the public by the city.

The pdf file used as the first source dataset for the analysis herein.  It clearly differs somewhat from the dataset Transportation Staff used for their presentation to council.  As an example, staff mentioned that they have received approximately 1900 public comments on ‘right’-sizing but this pdf document contains only 1609 public comments on ‘right’-sizing.

However there are an additional 336 comment rows  in the Folsom Street Feedback Excel file. One of these was clearly a Test with no actual content, so the final tally is 335 comments in the Excel file. These comments were visually scanned against the Inspire Boulder comments in the pdf and did not appear to overlap. Together, these two files total to 1941 comments, which is close to the approximately 1900 comments staff mentioned in their presentation to council.

In all likelihood then, these two files together constitute the dataset of public comment the city had received as of the presentation to council at the study session.  Congratulations to staff for being transparent and releasing the data!
