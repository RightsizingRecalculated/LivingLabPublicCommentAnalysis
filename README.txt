On Aug 25th, at the Boulder City Council Study Session, Kathleen Bracke from the GoBoulder staff presented a statistical breakdown of approximately 950 public comments on the Folsom corridor 'right'-sizing in which she claimed that the public comments were 57% positive to 40% negative, suggesting that the public comment was supportive of the 'right'-sizing.

That is not true.  

An alert reader of the Camera commented that a word search of the "Summary of Feedback" pdf indicated that the word "negative" occured almost twice as often as the word "positive". The reader noted that not all of those occured in the "Reaction" column of pdf where staff classified the comment as negative or positive, but most did.

That inspired me to do this project. Over the past 5 days I have gathered all the public comments that were published on the Living Laboratory website and put them together as a single dataset in a spreadsheet.

This spreadsheet demonstrates that the public comment on the Folsom-corridor rightsizing is actually 50% negative to 43% positive.

GoBoulder staff noted that they had received approximately 1900 public comments on 'right'-sizing, but did not supply a  statistical breakdown for all the public comments received.

This spreadsheet shows that for all 1944 published public comments on 'right'-sizing regardless of corridor, 59% were negative while only 35% were positive.

But don't take my word for it. Look through this spreadsheet, sort and play with the data. Look carefully at the original pdfs from the Living Lab website. Retrace the steps I performed as I did this analysis.
