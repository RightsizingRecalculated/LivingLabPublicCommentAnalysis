On 9/2/2015 the Living Lab staff updated their website to provide a different "Summary of Community Feedback" pdf than the original "Summary of Feedback" pdf with which this project began. Staff also very kindly provided it in excel spreadsheet format, making it much easier for an independent party to tabulate. This dataset does not include the 335 comments in the Inspire Boulder worksheet; instead, it contains previously unpublished public comments.

Note that this dataset of public comments is different than the dataset that the city previously provided. It contains at least 315 comments that were not in the original pdf, which contained only 1606. There are now 1921 total comments. I have not been able to yet determine if any comments were deleted (duplicates). Some comments appear to have been classified differently in today documents than they were the original—for example, there are no more “mixed” classifications in the Reaction column.

The data also seems to have been cleaned up from the original pdf released on 8/25/15.  In any cases the date of comment has been changed (sometimes this is clearly a correction, i.e. for comments dated in 2011, but often less clearly so). There is more regularity in the Corridor column, where almost all typos much as “Folso m” present in the previous document have been fixed, and variations in the field has been better normalized (i.e. “folsom” and “Folsom” have been all changed to “Folsom Street”). Some of the other columns have been similarly normalized. A few typos remain.

I have determined that the new comments were from the following sources (24 were from Inquire Boulder, a “Method of Contact” not present at all in the original pdf; there are two additional telephone contacts, and the balance (approximately 289) are emails. Most of those newly released emails (at least 211) appear to have been generated from a form letter on the People For Bikes website (the agency at which the previous GoBoulder manager Martha Roskowski now works).  The content of these new emails are nearly identical, as can be expected from a form letter. I am less concerned about a non-profit’s use of a form email letter generator (normal in these sorts of public comment periods) than I am with the city’s suddenly “discovering” these emails and posting them after the fact, without acknowledging that there had been a mistake in the original release of public comments. But the source of these emails does make it clear why the percentages in the city’s newly released data skew more positive than what they originally released.

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION:

Despite the large number of positive and largely form emails the city has found, when all comments are considered the newly revised statistical breakdown is 53% negative to 41% positive. Staff did not choose to present this breakdown of the 1921 total comments to council.

Using the revised dataset I was able to build a subset marked as “Folsom street” only of 977 public comments, which is close to the approximate 950 comments GoBoulder staff mentioned to council. That is 325 more comments than I had found in the original pdf, which suggests that some revisions have been made to the corridor classification of previously released comments. Since the vast majority of the new released form emails were positive and directed at Folsom, the percentages of the Folsom-only subset from the original pdf have changed dramatically. Using the city’s newly released data, I now calculate the Folsom-only percentages at 58% positive to 39% negative. 

While that’s reasonably close to the 57% positive 40% negative staff reported, I am still concerned that staff chose to report only that statistic breakdown to council. By reporting public comments marked as “Folsom Street” ONLY, staff has chosen to exclude a large number of comments that are clearly addressed to, for example, both Folsom and Iris, or at all corridors. As I have shown in the original analysis, excluding other corridors from the analysis makes the public comments seem more positive about rightsizing on Folsom than the public comment actually is. In fact, under almost any other set of criteria the public comment skews negative.

Finally, I am a bit surprised that the 335 Inspire Boulder comments have not yet been incorporated into the counts, though my (preliminary) analysis showed them skewing negative on Folsom and would have been a nice additional piece of data to include in the percentages presented to council. And of course, there are some coding errors (a few positive comments that are clearly misclassified positive or neutral; and vice versa), but not enough to appear statistically significant so that is not a worry I presently have.

CONCLUSIONS:

As a statistician, I am relieved to say that the mystery of how GoBoulder staff calculated their percentages now appears to have been solved. Although I am somewhat suspicious of the city’s sudden discovery of previously unreleased emails, that much could have been an inadvertent error. The original pdf did not contain data that supported that statistical breakdown, but the newly released (9/2) pdf and excel files render the breakdown in the 8/25 presentation to council statistically plausible.

But I am also now more certain than before that GoBoulder staff have not telling the whole truth about the public comment on rightsizing. In not reporting the statistical breakdown of all the public comment, and by making arbitrary and highly questionable decisions on which public comments to exclude. In doing so, GoBoulder’s Kathleen Bracke did not convey the public comment to council in a fair and impartial way; instead, by picking the most favorable subset of the public comment they could, GoBoulder staff indisputably acted as partisan advocates for the rightsizing project. 

That was wrong; city staff should not selectively report on public comment to advance an  agenda of their own.


NOTES:

The original "Summary of Feedback" pdf has now vanished from the Living Lab wesite, but it is preserved in the Step 1 folder inside of the StepByStep folder. 

Due to the late hour, the publication of the supporting analysis (spreadsheets, etc.) will have to wait until another day. There’s a lot of careful cleanup to do and I do have a day job.

The original readme.txt follows.  Note that given the city’s newly released addition public comments, it appears that adding the 335 public comments from Inspire Boulder was misguided.

--------------------

On Aug 25th, at the Boulder City Council Study Session, Kathleen Bracke from the GoBoulder staff presented a statistical breakdown of approximately 950 public comments on the Folsom corridor 'right'-sizing in which she claimed that the public comments were 57% positive to 40% negative, suggesting that the public comment was supportive of the 'right'-sizing.

That is not true.  

An alert reader of the Camera commented that a word search of the "Summary of Feedback" pdf indicated that the word "negative" occured almost twice as often as the word "positive". The reader noted that not all of those occured in the "Reaction" column of pdf where staff classified the comment as negative or positive, but most did.

That inspired me to do this project. Over the past 5 days I have gathered all the public comments that were published on the Living Laboratory website and put them together as a single dataset in a spreadsheet.

This spreadsheet demonstrates that the public comment on the Folsom-corridor rightsizing is actually 50% negative to 43% positive.

GoBoulder staff noted that they had received approximately 1900 public comments on 'right'-sizing, but did not supply a  statistical breakdown for all the public comments received.

This spreadsheet shows that for all 1944 published public comments on 'right'-sizing regardless of corridor, 59% were negative while only 35% were positive.

But don't take my word for it. Look through this spreadsheet, sort and play with the data. Look carefully at the original pdfs from the Living Lab website. Retrace the steps I performed as I did this analysis.
